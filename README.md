Please refer to the RMS Seamless Integration docs if you need any further options.

https://github.com/RazerMS/Integration-RazerMS_JavaScript_Seamless_Integration/wiki/Latest-Razer-Merchant-Services-Seamless-Integration-(non-PCI)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting Started
First, clone the repo and run `npm install` to install the necessary packages. Then, edit the .env.local first based on your merchant ID and environment:
```
ENVIRONMENT=SANDBOX
MERCHANTID=merchant_id_here
VERIFY_KEY=merchant_verify_key
```

Finally, run the development server:


```bash
npm run dev
```

`Note`: You can change the port number here:` "dev": "next -p 8080"` under `package.json` file.

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
